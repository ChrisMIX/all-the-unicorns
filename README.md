# A Magical Code Challenge

At SnapMobile, we use the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) for all of our iOS, Android, and Windows Phone development. We also (mainly Brandonâ€¦ really only Brandon) think unicorns are a magical creature and can't get enough of them. What would make all of our lives better is an app that gets GIFs of unicorns from the [Giphy API](https://api.giphy.com/). 

Here's what a user should be able to do in our dream app:

* See an infinitely scrolling list of unicorn GIFs in a grid
* Click on a small GIF in the grid and have it enlarge
* Search for other GIFs (some crazy people like cute cats more)
* (Bonus) Have another tab in the app that shows trending GIFs
* (Bonus) Whatever other magic you want to add

We're not expecting you to create a beautifully designed app, but you get bonus points if it doesn't look ugly.

When you're ready, send over your GitHub URL. If you've stumbled upon this and want to submit your app, send it to hello@snapmobile.io.

Together we will help everyone understand the beauty of the unicorn!
